# 👉 Next Steps: Build on SuperStack

You now have SuperStack running — a clean, composable backend you can deploy
anywhere. From here, it’s time to start building your own app on top of it.

## Where to go next

SuperStack keeps the main documentation focused on setup and deployment.

Once you’ve got your stack running, the GitHub Wiki is where the real fun begins.
