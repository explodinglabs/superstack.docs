SuperStack uses Docker, so make sure [Docker is
installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before you begin.

## 1. Get SuperStack

Click [Use this template](https://github.com/explodinglabs/superstack/generate)
and create a new repository (e.g. `myapp-backend`) on GitHub.

Clone it to your machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourname/myapp-backend.git
cd myapp-backend
```

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```sh
cd app
cp example.env .env
```

The `.env` file is used to set secrets, passwords, keys, etc.

> ⚠️ Never store secrets in version control.

## 3. Start the App

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

That's it – your backend is ready for development.

Test it with:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
OK
```
