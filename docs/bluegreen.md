_Blue/Green deployment_ runs two stacks side-by-side: one live, one idle. You
deploy to the idle stack, test it, and when ready, swap roles. It gives
near-zero downtime and easy rollback.

Blue/Green adds some complexity because where before there was just "the
stack", now there is:

1. A `blue` stack
2. A `green` stack
3. A proxy to direct traffic
4. An external Postgres container.

## 1. Caddy Adjustments

### Name the Caddy containers

Naming the Caddy containers `blue_caddy` and `green_caddy` allows the proxy to
direct traffic to the correct stacks:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
caddy:
  container_name: ${STACK_NAME}_caddy
```

### Remove exposed ports

We'll no longer expose ports in our stacks. Instead a proxy will sit in front
of the two stacks, proxying to them.

Remove the Caddy service's `ports:` section in `compose.yaml`.

### Serve HTTP-only in the stacks

Set `CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS` to only `:80`, removing `:443`, leaving TLS
termination to the proxy:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
caddy:
  environment:
    CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS: :80
```

## 2. Postgres

In regular SuperStack, Postgres comes up with the stack. But now we're bringing
up two stacks, we can't have two Postgres containers both simultaneously
accessing the same shared volume. We need a single Postgres container, separate
from the stacks.

Add a profile to the Postgres service:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
postgres:
  profiles: ["db"]
```

Add it to the Compose file:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
networks:
  postgres:
    name: postgres
    external: true
```

Then in services that need database access (such as PostgREST):

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
networks:
  - postgres
```

Move Postgres out of compose.yaml into a shared-compose.yaml, adding the `shared` network:

## 3. Volumes

To share data between the two stacks (uploads, etc.), give volumes explicit
names:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
volumes:
  user_data:
    name: user-data
```

## 4. Bring up two Stacks

Deploying is the same as [before](deploying.md), but now we're deploying the
_idle stack_. For this example, `green` is idle so that's the one we're
deploying.

Create `blue` and `green` directories on the server and copy `compose.yaml`
into the idle stack's directory:

```sh
scp compose.yaml youruser@yourserver:green/compose.yaml
```

Shell into the server and bring up the idle stack:

```sh
cd green
docker compose pull
STACK_NAME=green docker compose up -d
```

Docker will use the directory name `green` as the project name, creating
different containers, volumes and networks than the `blue` stack.

## 5. Add a Proxy

The proxy is a single container that binds ports `80` and `443` on the
server and routes requests into either the Blue or Green stack.

On the server, create a simple `Caddyfile`:

```caddyfile title="caddy/Caddyfile"
api.myapp.com {
  reverse_proxy blue_caddy:80
}
```

Optionally, point a second hostname to the idle stack for testing.

The front proxy manages TLS, so give it a persistent volume for certificates:

```sh
docker volume create caddy_data
```

Start the proxy, attaching it to both networks â€“ this requires both stacks to
be up first, so the networks exist:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name front-proxy \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v ./caddy:/etc/caddy \
  -v caddy_data:/data \
  --network blue_default \
  --network green_default \
  caddy:2
```

## 6. Upgrading

## Flip traffic

Point traffic to the `green` stack:

```caddyfile title="Caddyfile"
api.myapp.com {
  reverse_proxy green_caddy:80
}
```

Reload the proxy's config:

```sh
docker exec front-proxy caddy reload
```

Cutover is instant. Green is now live, and Blue is the idle stack.

And rollback is simple: flip the `Caddyfile` back and `caddy reload` again.

## Github Actions

Here's a workflow for B/G deploys:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yaml"

            ${{ secrets.VPS_USER }}@${{ secrets.VPS_HOST }} \
            'cat active_stack 2>/dev/null || echo blue')

          if [ "$ACTIVE" = "blue" ]; then
            echo "IDLE=green" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "IDLE=blue" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

          username: ${{ secrets.VPS_USER }}
          port: 22
          key: ${{ secrets.VPS_SSH_KEY }}
          source: "compose.yaml"
          target: "${{ steps.idle.outputs.IDLE }}/"

      - name: Deploy idle stack
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.VPS_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.VPS_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.VPS_SSH_KEY }}
          envs: GHCR_PAT
          script: |
            set -euo pipefail
            echo "${{ steps.idle.outputs.ACTIVE }}" > active_stack
            cd ${{ steps.idle.outputs.IDLE }}
            echo "$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u "${{ github.actor }}" --password-stdin
            DOCKER_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=300 COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=300 docker compose pull -q
            STACK_NAME=${{ steps.idle.outputs.IDLE }} docker compose up -d
        env:
          GHCR_PAT: ${{ secrets.GHCR_PAT }}
```

If you want to auto-flip between blue and green, add this extra task:

```yaml
- name: Flip traffic
  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.VPS_HOST }}
    username: ${{ secrets.VPS_USER }}
    key: ${{ secrets.VPS_SSH_KEY }}
    script: |
      if [ "${{ steps.idle.outputs.IDLE }}" = "blue" ]; then
        sed -i 's/green_caddy/blue_caddy/g' caddy/Caddyfile
      else
        sed -i 's/blue_caddy/green_caddy/g' caddy/Caddyfile
      fi
      docker exec front-proxy caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      echo "${{ steps.idle.outputs.IDLE }}" > active_stack
```
