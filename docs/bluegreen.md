Blue/Green deployment runs two stacks side-by-side: one live, one idle. You
deploy to the idle stack, test it, and when ready, swap roles â€” giving
near-zero downtime and easy rollback.

## 1. Adjust the Compose file

### Remove exposed ports

We'll no longer expose ports in the stacks, instead a simple "front proxy" will
sit in front of the two stacks, exposing ports and proxying to the active
stack. So remove the Caddy service's `ports:` section in `compose.yaml`.

### Serve http-only in the stacks

Set `CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS` to only `:80` (leaving TLS termination to the front
proxy):

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
caddy:
  environment:
    CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS: :80
```

### Share volumes between the stacks

To share data between the two stacks (database, uploads, etc.), give volumes
explicit names:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
volumes:
  postgres_data:
    name: postgres-data
  user_data:
    name: user-data
```

### Make the networks external

The front proxy needs to connect to both `blue_default` and `green_default`
networks. This makes it easier to start the front proxy regardless of whether
the stacks are up:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
networks:
  default:
    external: true
```

In the override file, don't use external networks:

```yaml title="compose.override.yaml"
networks:
  default:
    external: false
```

Shell into the server and manually create the two networks:

```sh
docker network create blue_default
docker network create green_default
```

## 3. Add a Front Proxy

The _front proxy_ is a single container that binds ports `80` and `443` on the
server and routes requests into either the Blue or Green stack.

On the server, create a simple `Caddyfile`:

```caddyfile title="Caddyfile"
api.myapp.com {
  reverse_proxy blue_caddy:80
}
```

Optionally, point a second hostname to the idle stack for testing.

The front proxy manages TLS, so give it a persistent volume for certificates:

```sh
docker volume create caddy_data
```

Start the proxy, attaching it to both networks:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name front-proxy \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile \
  -v caddy_data:/data \
  --network blue_default \
  --network green_default \
  caddy:2
```

## 4. Deploying/Upgrading

Deploying is the same as [before](deploying.md), but now we're deploying the
_idle stack_. For this example, `green` is idle so that's the one we're
deploying.

Create `blue` and `green` directories on the server and copy `compose.yaml`
into the idle stack's directory:

```sh
scp compose.yaml youruser@yourserver:green/compose.yaml
```

Shell into the server and bring up the idle stack:

```sh
cd green
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Docker will use the directory name `green` as the project name, creating
different containers, volumes and networks than the `blue` stack.

### Flip traffic

Point traffic to the `green` stack:

```caddyfile title="Caddyfile"
api.myapp.com {
  reverse_proxy green_caddy:80
}
```

Reload the front proxy's config:

```sh
docker exec front-proxy caddy reload
```

Cutover is instant. Green is now live, and Blue is the idle stack.

And rollback is simple: flip the `Caddyfile` back and `caddy reload` again.

## Github Actions
