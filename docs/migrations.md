# üìú Migrations

SuperStack includes a simple built-in system for managing database schema
migrations.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Migrations

Place your migration scripts in:

```
postgres/migrations/
```

Each file should be:

- An `.sql` file
- Numbered in order (e.g. `00-init.sql`, `01-extensions.sql`, `02-auth.sql`)
- Written in plain SQL
- But can include environment variables.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Applying Migrations

When the Postgres container starts with no existing data, SuperStack will
automatically run migrations once.

After the first startup, migrations will only run if you manually apply
them.

To apply your migrations, run:

```sh
bin/postgres migrate
```

This will:

1. Run any migration files that haven‚Äôt been applied yet (in filename order)
2. Record each successfully applied file in `.applied_migrations` (this
   file lives in the postgres data volume)

Already-applied scripts are skipped on subsequent runs.

> üí° `bin/postgres` is a small script that basically aliases `docker compose exec postgres`

Here's an example migration script:

```sql title="postgres/migrations/02-create_table_example.sql"
begin;

create table director (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null
);

create table movie (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null,
  director_id integer references director(id)
);

commit;
```

## üîÅ Transactions

Use `begin;` and `commit;` to wrap statements in a transaction. This
ensures that all changes are applied atomically. Any statements outside of
transactions will be auto-committed.

Avoid wrapping non-transactional operations in a transaction ‚Äî these will
cause errors if used inside `begin ... commit`. Examples of
non-transactional statements include:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION
DROP EXTENSION
VACUUM
REINDEX
CLUSTER
CREATE DATABASE
DROP DATABASE
CREATE ROLE
CREATE TABLESPACE
DROP TABLESPACE
ALTER SYSTEM
DISCARD ALL
LOAD
```

## üîÑ Nuke Everything

If you want to start fresh, wipe your database and re-run all migrations from
scratch:

```sh
docker compose down --volumes
docker compose up -d
```
